Problem statement: *How might we allow people with Intellectual Disability (ID) to correct & learn socially acceptable ways to communicate such that he/she can express his/her thoughts & feelings without offending others.*

Proposed Solution: *We will be making a companion app in python aimed to cultivate and correct socially acceptable behavious in people with IDs.*

The proposed companion app has these 3 main features:
1. A training simulator for those who can verbally communicate - An app that comes up with senarios and analyses reply based on acceptibility and facial expressions (Kazu)
2. A training simulator for those who cannot verbally communicate - teaching appropriate sign languages, sign language decoder and a function to create new and ;unique; sign language customised for each person (Yanzhao)
3. A spam limter (Kiran)
