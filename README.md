Problem statement: *How might we allow people with Intellectual Disability (ID) to correct & learn socially acceptable ways to communicate such that he/she can express his/her thoughts & feelings without offending others?*

Proposed Solution: A companion app aimed to cultivate better social skills and correct behavior in those with IDs. 

The proposed companion app has these 3 main features:
1. A training simulator for those who can verbally communicate - An app that comes up with senarios and analyses reply based on acceptibility and facial expressions (Kazu)
2. A training simulator for those who cannot verbally communicate - teaching appropriate sign languages, sign language decoder and a function to create new and ;unique; sign language customised for each person (Yanzhao)
3. A spam limter (Kiran)
